# Yolo's Realm | Play Samples

Yolo's Realm is a sample app developed to showcase how to integrate one-time
products (OTPs) with the Play Billing Library. It follows Play Billing Library
best practices and is intended to be used only as a reference for developers.

A damo android app has been developed using this sample which you can
download form [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.play.billing.samples.onetimepurchases&hl=en_IN)
